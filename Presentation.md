135r_3

Hector, being clamorous and boastful, summons together all the best (of his men) in an unsensible manner; the Greeks, however, are brief (in words).

135v_4

Hector, on one hand, calls for someone who will yield to his command out of necessity; Nestor, on the other hand, makes a suggestion. And they (the Greeks) will promise what they have, but he (Hector) (promises) what he does not have. And they (the Greeks) deem it a gift, but he (Hector) dishonorably deems it a wages.

136r_4

 The unreliability of barbarians becomes evident because they (the Trojans) do not confirm the assurances by oaths in the right ways.

136r_6

Hector says he will give the best (horses): Dolon on the other hand is asking for Achilles’, knowing that those are the best: it makes clear the absurdity and lack of sense of either of them.

135v_2

At the same time both (Nestor and Hector) send watchmen for they happen to meet one another: the poet however honors the Greek (side) by the placing of their story in front.

136r_2

The poet (Homer) appears to be very vexed, what kind of a man makes an attempt at such men.

Conclusions

- There is a well demonstrated preference for the Greeks over the Trojans in our bifolio's scholia
- Literary criticism, here seen as exegetical scholia, allows a modern reader to see the prejudice of those editing our manuscripts in the 11th century.

 ---
Further Questions

- Do the other folios show this preference as well?
- Are there preferences for other ethnicities throughout scholia?
- Could we do a topic model on the scholia across a manuscript broken down by book to find out about these preferences?
- Could this have influenced how the writing was edited? Would a scribe or scholiast make a minor change in the main text to further support their prejudice?
