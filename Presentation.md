 ### Hector, on one hand, calls for someone who will yield to his command out of necessity; Nestor, on the other hand, makes a suggestion. And they [= the Greeks] will promise what they have, but he [= Hector] [promises] what he does not have. And they [= the Greeks] deem it a gift, but he [= Hector] dishonourably deems it a wages.

 ### Hector says he will give the best [horses]: Dolon on the other hand is asking for Achilles’, knowing that those are the best: it makes clear the absurdity and lack of sense of either of them.
